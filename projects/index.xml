      <description>COMP4DRONES is a European project that aims to provide a framework of key technologies to facilitate safe and autonomous drones. It will ease the development of new applications and functionalities on the field of transport, construction, surveillance and inspection, logistics and agriculture.
My work in the project focuses on the use case of inspection of wind turbines. More specifically I aim at detecting degradation in the form of corrosion. To that end, I am using data acquired with imec&amp;rsquo;s dual hyperspectral camera system.</description>

      <description>The goal of this project was to develop a generic interoperability framework for augmented reality applications. The platform is able to host a variety of applications in the domains of remote collaboration, engineering, smart cities, gaming, entertainment, etc. My task in the project was focused on the modelling and analysis of the environment by means of 3D reconstruction and the detection of 3D geometric primitives.</description>

      <description>The goal of this project is to provide tools for fault localization, power loss quantification and improved diagnostics of PV power plants. A more efficient detection, diagnosis and localization of the fault will lead to a reduced time during which the fault can impact production.
My work in the project consists of developing image processing techniques to detect and classify anomalies that occur on solar panels including bypass substrings, junction box issues, diode issues, string issues and potential induced defects (PID).</description>
