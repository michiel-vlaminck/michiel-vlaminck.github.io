<p>Below you can find the courses I have been involved with during my doctoral and postdoctoral career at Ghent University.</p>
<h2 id="information-technology-for-industrial-engineering-2023-present">Information Technology for Industrial Engineering (2023-Present)</h2>
<p>I am lecturer in charge for the course Information Technology for Industrial Engineering or IT4E (<a href="https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/studiefiche/en/E076341/2023">ECTS-card</a>), which is taught in the Master of Science in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. The aim of this course is to provide students with a general overview of the ICT domain, data communications and data processing.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/teaching/IT4IE.jpg" alt="IT4IE"></p>
<h2 id="computer-graphics-2014-present">Computer graphics (2014-Present)</h2>
<p>The course computer graphics (<a href="https://studiegids.ugent.be/2020/NL/studiefiches/E016712.pdf">ECTS-card</a>), lectured by prof. Aleksandra Pizurica, is taught in the Master Computer Science Engineering. I take care of the projects of the course, which consist of a programming assignment (using OpenGL or VTK) and focus on a particular subtopic of computer graphics. Among the topics are 3D scene generation, 3D space partitioning and mesh simplification.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/teaching/computergraphics.png" alt="Computer Graphics"></p>
<h2 id="research-project-2020-present">Research project (2020-Present)</h2>
<p>Research Project (<a href="https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/studiefiche/en/E031710/2023">ECTS-card</a>) is a course in the Master Computer Science Engineering. The aim of the course is to teach the students elementary elements of scientific research, and especially on the process of searching the literature and scientific writing. Each year I supervise a group of students that work on a different topic. Below is the list of past project topics.</p>
<h4 id="2021---multi-agent-slam">2021 - Multi-agent SLAM</h4>
<p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is the problem of giving a robot (or agent) placed at an unknown location in an unknown environment the ability to incrementally build a consistent map of this environment while simultaneously determining its location within this map. Historically, SLAM methods have been designed mostly for single-agent scenarios: the agent builds a map and localizes itself as it evolves in the area, without any information exchange with peers. For a wide range of use cases, extending these systems to allow multi-agent operation brings a lot of value: the area to be mapped can be covered more quickly and information can be shared, reused and corrected by the different agents.</p>
<h4 id="2020---hyperspectral-image-classification">2020 - Hyperspectral image classification</h4>
<p>Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technique that captures a wide spectrum of light instead of just assigning primary colors (red, green, blue) to each pixel. The light striking each pixel is broken down into many different spectral bands in order to provide more information on what is imaged. As such, each pixel is represented by a vector, in which each element is a measurement corresponding to a specific wave-length. The goal of hyperspectral image classification is to assign a class label to each pixel in the hyperspectral image.</p>
<h2 id="bachelor-project-2020">Bachelor project (2020)</h2>
<p>Bachelor Project is a course in the bachelor Industrial Engineering: Electronics ICT. The students use the skills and knowledge from different courses and apply them to an existing problem that is relevant for today&rsquo;s industry. In 2020 I supervised a student who has worked on a novel visualization tool for hyperspectral image processing that allows efficient querying in both the temporal, spatial and spectral dimension.</p>
<h2 id="information-technology-and-data-processing-2014-2021">Information technology and data processing (2014-2021)</h2>
<p>The course information technology and data processing was taught in the Master of Science in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. I assisted the practical exercise sessions, where students are taught on how to query a relational database by means of the SQL query language. The course was abolished and replaced by Information Technology for Industrial Engineering (IT4IE).</p>
