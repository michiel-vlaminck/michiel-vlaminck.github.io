    </header>

    <p>All this means that a system is needed that is able to perform 3D mapping - and thus also 3D positioning - based on sensors that are able to perceive the environment, such as cameras or depth sensors. In the scientific literature, this problem is also known as <em>simultaneous localization and mapping</em> or SLAM as it involves both the precise localization of the robot and the mapping of the environment at the same time. Current 3D mapping solutions are either too slow or they are insufficiently accurate or robust. Moreover, they are often still relying on external positioning, which makes them unsuitable in a lot of circumstances. In this work, we invented techniques that allow to build a 3D map of the environment in real-time and solely using data captured with active depth sensors.</p>
<p>The research contributions of this work focus on three major improvements in the domain of 3D mapping and localization. First, we developed techniques to accelerate the mapping process making it possible to reconstruct the environment in high detail in real-time. This means that the data is aggregated into a 3D map at the rate it comes in, such that it can be used by autonomous robots to navigate themselves within the environment. It also allows AR applications to use the 3D map to enrich the field of view of the user with virtual objects. Thanks to the high level of detail of the reconstructions the system can also be used for real-time inspection purposes or real-time damage assessment.</p>
<p>Second, we focused on algorithms that improve the accuracy of mobile 3D mapping to a level above what is available in the academic literature. In addition, we developed techniques to dynamically adjust the level of detail, making it possible to tune the speed versus accuracy trade-off depending on the use case or the `circumstances&rsquo;, e.g. in case of resource-constrained operating platforms. Third, we focused on the robustness of the 3D SLAM process in order to avoid situations in which the <em>tracking</em> is lost due to failures in one of the different sub-processes. Below we explain the main research contributions of this work.</p>
