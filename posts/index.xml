      <description>Today I successfully defended my PhD entitled &amp;ldquo;3D mapping using active depth sensors&amp;rdquo; [link]. Due to the COVID-19 measures, I was obligated to do defense remotely, from home. Fortunately, technology didn&amp;rsquo;t let me down and everything went fine. I can call myself a doctor in computer science engineering from now on. Thanks to everyone who helped me during the past 6 years!
I also owe a special word of thanks to my girlfriend, who surprised me with a self-assembled PhD hat, for which I am very grateful!</description>

      <description>Today I gave a presentation at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) Tubingen in Germany [link]. I presented my work regarding 3D mapping using lidar scanners. I gave an overview of the SLAM problem and its main challenges: robustness, accuracy and processing speed. Regarding robustness and accuracy, I explained a better point cloud representation based on resampling and surface reconstruction. I also pointed out how it can be incorporated in an ICP-based scan matching technique and explained globally consistent mapping using loop closures.</description>
