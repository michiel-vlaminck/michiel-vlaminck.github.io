      <title>Successfully defended my PhD</title>

      <description>Today I successfully defended my PhD entitled &amp;ldquo;3D mapping using active depth sensors&amp;rdquo; [link]. Due to the COVID-19 measures, I was obligated to do defense remotely, from home. Fortunately, technology didn&amp;rsquo;t let me down and everything went fine. I can call myself a doctor in computer science engineering from now on. Thanks to everyone who helped me during the past 6 years!
I also owe a special word of thanks to my girlfriend, who surprised me with a self-assembled PhD hat, for which I am very grateful!</description>

      <title>Scanning Sculpture House Gillet</title>
      <link>https://michiel-vlaminck.github.io/posts/house-gillet/</link>

      <description>Today we did a measurement campaign in and around the Sculpture House Gillet, located in Angleur, close to Liege, in Belgium.
The house is extraordinary as it was entirely built using shotcrete - also known as sprayed concrete - which allowed the creation of walls that are irregularly shaped, as can be seen in Figure 1. As a result, the house does not meet the `Manhattan-world&amp;rsquo; assumption and lacks any kind of organization in the form of orthogonal and parallel planes.</description>

      <description>Today and tomorrow I am staffing a demo booth at the annual imec ITF conference, held in the Queen Elisabeth conert hall. Like last year, I will demonstrate our Liborg rover that we use to perform 3D mapping.
Compared to last year, we improved the rover by replacing the raspberry pi by an nVidia Jetson TX2. This way, the 3D mapping can be done on the rover itself instead of transmitting the data to an external server to compute the 3D model.</description>

      <description>This week, I am visiting the lab Autonomous Vision Group (AVG) of prof. Andreas Geiger at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Intelligent Systems in Tubingen, Germany [link]. Today, I presented my work on 3D mapping using lidar scanners.
In my presentation I give an overview of the SLAM problem and its main challenges: robustness, accuracy and processing speed. Regarding robustness and accuracy, I explained a better point cloud representation based on resampling and surface reconstruction.</description>

      <description>Together with colleague Hiep Luong, I am visiting the MICA Research Institue in Hanoi (Vietnam) during the next two weeks. We will work together on two development cooperation projects with Vietnam funded by Nafosted-FWO and VLIR-UOS about rehabilition for visually impaired people.
The goal in those projects is to build a system to improve the mobility of visually impaired people by providing them a navigation system to easily find their way to their destination.</description>
